This is the source code for [EasyA](https://easya.io/).

The so called "respected" and "reputed" clients didn't pay for us, so I decided to make my work (our team's hard work) public.

We tried several times to contact them but we didn't get a response. I hereby release the code in GPL. Feel free to use it however you want.

## Inspiration
Everyone who is counted as someone in this day and age has had a starting phase, and everyone can use some help when they are stuck. 
So [EasyA](https://easya.io/) is here to help people out when they are stuck with their studies.
Suppose a student is being taught something in the class, he gets confused, doesnt get it cleared due to peer pressure. 
So by using this application, anyone can ask their questions to qualified experts for free, get one on one sessions and have their doubts cleared.


## What it does
Just Click a photo of the question, upload it. And we will reach back to you. That is EasyA.
And this repository is a portfolio for EasyA. To redirect people to install the app on their end devices.
We will also be sharing the benifits, other services, updates here.
## How it was built
This project was opened to anyone to upgrade it however they want, and it still is.
Set up an issue, we will look into it and assign it to you.
Styling was done using SCSS.
And it is based on React framework.
## Challenges we ran into
We have lots of people requesting to contribute a new feature onto this. 
So it becomes hard to accept the reuests while at the same time make sure the application wouldnt deviate from the main idea.
## What you will learn after contributing.
Get more experienced at open sourcing.
Apply what you learnt and learn to apply.
Any small and good issue raised can help a random kids growth.
If you are a GSSoC ’21 you will also get the participant's credits.
## What's next for EasyA
Based on user response on the application, this can be upgraded to add new features.
We are waiting for more Open-sourcers to contribute.

## Disclaimer

We're happy to make this private once again, once the payment is made.
