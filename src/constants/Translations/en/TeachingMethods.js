      "EasyA was founded on the belief that students learn better when they are given the help they need, when they need it.",
      "What started out as a simple hypothesis by two former tutors (now our co-founders), based on their own teaching experience, has proven to be true.",
      "We took two groups of students from leading schools across the U.K. and looked at their academic performance over the course of a year. One group was beginning of the experiment the year, the students who had EasyA were scoring 82% on average vs 78% and by the end of the year, students on EasyA had an average score of 95% compared to 82% by the end of the year.",
      "More importantly, these results are being felt by the hundreds of students who are getting better 11+ and GCSE grades as the result of EasyA resulted in both groups scoring 75% and 74%. However, half way through."
