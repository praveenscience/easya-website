    Text1:
      "EasyA was founded on the belief that students learn better when they are given the help they need, when they need it.",
    Text2:
      "What started out as a simple hypothesis by two former tutors (now our co-founders), based on their own teaching experience, has proven to be true.",
    Text3:
      "We took two groups of students from leading schools across the U.K. and looked at their academic performance over the course of a year. One group was beginning of the experiment the year, the students who had EasyA were scoring 82% on average vs 78% and by the end of the year, students on EasyA had an average score of 95% compared to 82% by the end of the year.",
    Text4:
      "More importantly, these results are being felt by the hundreds of students who are getting better 11+ and GCSE grades as the result of EasyA resulted in both groups scoring 75% and 74%. However, half way through."
