      <h2>Data we collect</h2>

      <p>
        We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data
        about you as follows:
        <br />• Identity Data.
        <br />• Contact Data.
        <br />• Device Data.

        We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or
        demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from
        your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
        data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example,
        we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users
        accessing a specific App feature. However, if we combine or connect
        Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or
        indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data
        which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.
        <br />
        We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you
        (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
        philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions,
        trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and
        biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal
        convictions and offences.
      </p>

      <h2>How we collect data</h2>

      <p>
        We will collect and process the following data about you:
        <br />
        <br />• Information you give us. This is information (including
        Identity, Contact, and Marketing and Communications Data) you consent to
        giving us about you by filling in forms on the App and the Services
        Sites (together Our Sites), or by corresponding with us (for example, by
        email or chat). It includes information you provide when you register to
        use the App, subscribe to any of our Services, search for an App or
        Service, make an in-App purchase, or enter a competition, promotion or
        survey, and when you report a problem with an App, our Services, or any
        of Our Sites. If you contact us, we will keep a record of that
        correspondence.
        <br />
        <br />• Information we collect about you and your device. Each time you
        visit one of Our Sites or use one of our Apps we will automatically
        collect personal data including Device, Content and Usage Data. We
        collect this data using cookies and other similar technologies.
        <br />
        <br />• Information we receive from other sources including third
        parties and publicly available sources. We will receive personal data
        about you from various third parties. For example, analytics providers
        such as Google based outside the EU;
        <br />
        <br />• Unique application numbers. When you want to install or
        uninstall a Service containing a unique application number or when such
        a Service searches for automatic updates, that number and information
        about your installation, for example, the type of operating system, may
        be sent to us.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of the App, Website,
        the distribution platform (Appstore) or Services Sites and to remember
        your preferences. This helps us to provide you with a good experience
        when you use the App or browse any of Our Sites and also allows us to
        improve the App and Our Sites.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use your data</h2>

      <p>
        We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so.
        Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following
        circumstances:
        <br />• Where you have consented before the processing.
        <br />• Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter or
        have entered with you.
        <br />• Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of
        a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override
        those interests.
        <br />• Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
        <br />
        We will only send you direct marketing communications by email or text
        if we have your consent. You have the right to withdraw that consent at
        any time by contacting us.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>

      <p>
        We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group
        companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
        These rules are called “binding corporate rules”.
        <br />
        Some of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their
        processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside
        the EEA.
        <br />
        Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
        similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
        of the following safeguards is implemented:
        <br />• We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
        been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data
        by the European Commission.
        <br />• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
        contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data
        the same protection it has in Europe.
        <br />• Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
        them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
        provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and
        the US.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>

      <p>
        All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any
        payment transactions carried out by us or our chosen third-party
        provider of payment processing services will be encrypted. Where we have
        given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to
        access certain parts of Our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this
        password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
        <br />
        Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
        and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being
        accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.
        <br />
        We will collect and store personal data on your Device using application
        data caches.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data, such as where
        we have no good reason to retain it any longer.
        <br />
        In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it
        can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
        purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
        further notice to you.
      </p>

      <h2>Choice of law</h2>

      <p>
        This privacy policy, its subject matter and its formation, is governed
        by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and
        Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We keep our privacy policy under regular review.
        <br />
        This version was last updated on 24 September 2019. It may change and if
        it does, these changes will be posted on this page. The new policy may
        be displayed on-screen and you may be required to read and accept the
        changes to continue your use of the App or the Services.
